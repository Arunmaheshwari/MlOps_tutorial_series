# MlOps_tutorial_series


I am learning this series from iNeuron Intelligence youtube channel.

and in this i will learn everything about MlOps and i will also create some projects as well.
This is main MlOps series





1.Dockerfile              ## container
2.docker-compose.yaml    ## i can configure multiple images here
3.start.sh                ## any requirement from from the dockerfile
4. .dockerignore         ## it is for i want to exclude anything

these files are related to running airflow because airflow does not support Window Operating system.


1. airflow and dags folder for running the pipeline in airflow 

2. batch_prediction.py
3. traning_pipeline.py

both are files for running the pipeline in airflow







Note - 

docker compose up  

this command for running the docker file

and i have not installed docker so this work is remain.
